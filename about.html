      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>Our company is based on the old Norwegian saying <em>“There is no such thing as bad weather, there is only bad clothing”.</em></p>
      <p>We have been avid outdoor adventurers since childhood but there was always a little bit more hesitation to go for hikes if the weather forecast predicted rain. </p>
      <p>Why should that be? Nowadays people are busier than ever, balancing time at work, friends/family, with free time activities. What happens if it suddenly rains on your one day off? Or what if you're on holiday and have a limited time to see natural wonders but it is raining non-stop? </p>
      <p>Life is too short to be limited by bad weather.</p>
      <p>We've designed our products with this in mind. </p>

      <h1>Our values and beliefs</h1>
      <p>Durability and versatility is not only good for your wallet but also for the environment.</p>
      <p>As nature-lovers it has been extremely important to us that the quality and comfort of our products shouldn't come at the cost of the environment.</p>
      <p>Durability is an extremely important factor in combatting the increasing trend of “throw-away” mentality of the fashion industry. </p>
      <p>With classic and timeless designs we ensure that our jackets will keep in style throughout their long lifespan and even be passed on to the next generation. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Cerftifications</h1>
      <p>All the materials we use in our jackets meet the Oeko-Tex 100 certification standard.</p>
      <p>OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 is a label for textiles tested for harmful substances. It sets the benchmark for textile safety, from yarn to finished product. Every item bearing the STANDARD 100 label is certified as having passed safety tests for the presence of harmful substances</p>

      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
      <h2>Where is my order?</h2>
      <p>After having placed an order you will receive an email with your order confirmation. In this email you will find a link to your shipping/tracking number.</p>
      <h2>How do I know which size to choose?</h2>
      <p>Our size guide which is listed on the product page (right underneath the size selector) gives the measurements of the actual jacket and what body measurements they are likely to fit. If you are still unsure what size you need we recommend comparing the jacket measurements given to a garment you like the fit of.</p>
      <h2>The jacket I want is out of stock, when is it expected back in stock?</h2>
      <p>Our products will generally only be out of stock for up to two weeks at a time. If you would like to be notified when the product is back in stock sign up for our newsletter.</p>
